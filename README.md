# Bubble

A unique anti-procrastination app with a different concept than regular screen-monitoring app. 
The driving goal behind the app is to enable and encourage users to use their smartphones in a more productive manner. The app allows users to classify 
productive and non-productive apps. The app then creates a bubble that the user fills up with positive and negative energy based on the amount of time users
use productive or non-productive apps. In addition, if the app identifies that the user is using their non-productive apps for a greater amount of time than 
the productive apps, it would prevent users from interacting with the non-productive apps until they spend more time on productive apps. If the non-productive 
app usage time exceeds a user-defined limit, their bubble would pop and the points on the app would drastically decrease. The whole purpose of this unique user e
xperience is to encourage and help users to use their more for more productive tasks instead of procrastinating all day, especially during this lockdown. 
Regarding the development of the app, it was made from scratch with Android Studio and programmed in Java and Kotlin on the backend, XML on the frontend, and 
employs Gradle for Internal app management and library implementation. Ad Integration was also included in the App, developed with the Google Admob Interface 
and includes Interstitial and Banner Ads.
